            Would you like to become a speaker or suggest one? Great! This year we are reaching our global community and opening an informal call for speakers. Please, submit your proposals until June 30, 2019 using <a href="#contact">our contact form</a> and include speaker's name, topic, talk description and relevant links.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle text-center">
            This year's main topic is opt-out. Global censorship of freedom of speech, massive financial surveillance or upcoming drastic Internet regulations and most importantly, desperation from the impossibility to change the political system falling to a wrong direction, lead to workarounds and solutions that technologies may offer to opt-out the existing system and build the parallel one. We appreciate addressing and promoting these technologies including all opt-out and liberation guides.
          </p>
          <p class="subtitle text-center">
            We are also open to other topics and program suggestions that will enrich your congress experience.
