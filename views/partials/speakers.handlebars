                      Most of us think we know what a country is, but in truth the concept is notoriously slippery. This talk starts with the familiar political map of the world to show what the bold colours and clear boundaries conceal rather than reveal: a multitude of unrecognised and unnoticed states whose claims to legitimacy are deliberately made invisible. This is the shadowy, surprisingly large, and literally unofficial world of countries that don’t exist.

Based on his best-selling book of the same title, acclaimed travel writer and Oxford geography don, Nick Middleton, takes us on an eye-opening journey through this parallel world. These are wannabe countries that, lacking diplomatic recognition or UN membership, inhabit a realm of shifting borders, idealistic leaders and forgotten peoples. But although the places covered in this talk lie beyond the margins of legitimacy, virtually all can be visited in the real world.

Filled with stories, facts and figures, this is simultaneously an insight into the power of territorial countries, an introduction to creating your own nation state, and a bucket list of destinations from an alternative dimension. Above all, it’s an assortment of yearning tales of nationhood, most led by visionary leaders: some sad, some mad, some downright bizarre.

                      Crypto is disintermediating and commoditizing many things that used to be monopolies. Currency is an example of a monopoly that used to be owned by the nation state. But if we go to the very core of what nation states provide, they provide legal security and asset protection. They do that by implementing a court and legal system. Thanks to crypto and advancements in smart contract systems, we can now implement a fully decentralized court system. Let's explore how, and review how Aragon is implementing this system as an Internet-native jurisdiction for decentralized organizations and sovereign individuals.

                    Robin Hanson is associate professor of economics at George Mason University, and research associate at the Future of Humanity Institute of Oxford University. He has a doctorate in social science from California Institute of Technology, master's degrees in physics and philosophy from the University of Chicago, and nine years experience as a research programmer, at Lockheed and NASA.<br><br>Professor Hanson has 4126 citations, a citation h-index of 32, and over ninety academic publications. Oxford University Press published his book&nbsp;The Age of Em: Work, Love and Life When Robots Rule the Earth&nbsp;in June 2016, and his book&nbsp;The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life, co-authored with Kevin Simler, in January, 2018. Professor Hanson has 900 media mentions, given 350 invited talks, and his blog OvercomingBias.com has had eight million visits.<br><br>Professor Hanson has pioneered prediction markets, also known as information markets and idea futures, since 1988. He was the first to write in detail about creating and subsidizing markets to gain better estimates on a wide variety of important topics. He was a principal architect of the first internal corporate markets, at Xanadu in 1990, of the first web markets, the Foresight Exchange since 1994, of DARPA's Policy Analysis Market, from 2001 to 2003, and of IARPA's combinatorial markets DAGGRE and SCICAST from 2010 to 2015. Professor Hanson developed new technologies for conditional, combinatorial, and intermediated trading, and studied insider trading, manipulation, and other foul play. He has written and spoken widely on the application of idea futures to business and policy, and has advised many ventures. He suggests&nbsp;"futarchy", a form of governance based on prediction markets.<br><br>Robin has diverse research interests, with papers on spatial product competition, health incentive contracts, group insurance, product bans, evolutionary psychology and bioethics of health care, voter information incentives, incentives to fake expertise, Bayesian classification, agreeing to disagree, self-deception in disagreement, probability elicitation, wiretaps, image reconstruction, the history of science prizes, reversible computation, the origin of life, the survival of humanity, very long term economic growth, growth given machine intelligence, and interstellar colonization. He coined the phrase&nbsp;"The Great Filter"&nbsp;as part of an effort to understand why the universe looks so dead.

                      Most ancient societies used simple A-sues-B-for-cash legal systems to deal with most harms. But in the last few centuries, states added “crime law”, wherein the state investigates, sues, and imprisons “criminals.” These centrally-run one-size-fits-all bureaucratic systems don’t innovate well nor adapt well to individual conditions. And even though most of your “constitutional rights” are regarding such systems, they still seem badly broken. 

In the ancient world, a stranger who came to town was trusted more if a local “vouched” for them. We still use vouching today in bonded contractors, in organized crime, and in requiring most everyone to get an insurer who pays on their behalf if they cause a car accident. I propose requiring everyone to get an insurer to vouch for them regarding any crimes they might commit. If you are found guilty of a crime, your “voucher” pays the state a fine, and then pays to punish you according to your contract with them. This fine in part pays the private bounty-hunter who convinced the court of your guilt. Competing bounty-hunters obey law because they can’t maintain a blue-wall-of-silence.

To lower your voucher premiums, you might agree to (1) prison, torture, or exile, if caught, (2) prior limits on your freedom like curfews, ankle bracelets, and their reading your emails, and (3) co-liability wherein you and your buddies are all punished if any one of you is found guilty. In this system, the state still decides what behaviors are crimes and if any one accusation is true, and it sets fine and bounty levels regarding how hard to discourage and detect each kind of crime. But each person chooses their own “constitutional rights”, and vouchers acquire incentives and opportunity to innovate and adapt, by searching in a large space of ways to discourage crime.

                      Technological difficulties in connecting to the network, coupled with high prices and a control policy that attempts to censor sites where it disagrees with the government, create an atmosphere that hinders Cubans' relationship with the Internet.

Young people manage to overcome obstacles by creating alternative networks and looking for a type of VPN or anonymous proxy, but the authorities do not stop generating prohibitions arguing the need to guarantee computer security.

A strong social demand has been generated to improve connectivity and expand the spaces to visit. In the complicated situation of Cuba that suffers from the trade restrictions imposed by the United States and where the government applies an internal blockade, the solutions mix political audacity, technological innovation and economic entrepreneurship.

                      Yes, we all want to escape the pressures and abuse of the reigning systems, but things don’t become magically wonderful just because we’ve opted-out. New structures and new ways of living have to be built outside, and even though we’ve made a nice start, it has been just a small start. We have a long, long way to go.

We’re also guaranteed to face challenges on the outside, not only from bad people who may follow us there, but because none of us are fully developed, and we all carry some difficulties with us.

Being outside gives us space to build anew and to create better structures for ourselves, and then to improve ourselves. We’ll have to choose our actions well and we’ll have to work hard, but if we do, even the sky will be no limit.

                      Throughout history and around the world people have been 1) intent on controlling others; 2) content to be controlled; and 3) determined to be free of control by others. The latter group is constantly seeking and preparing contingencies for their own eventual and necessary escape to freedom. This can be aided by contemplating the paths taken by more than 240 million others in recent years with varying degrees of success. And surely the numbers would be much greater except for the multitude and measure of the obstacles. 

Some paths to freedom are crude and unsophisticated, but nonetheless imaginative and brazen. The most apparent and direct way to avoid the clutches of tyranny is to physically move to places of relatively less tyranny. The movement of great numbers of people around the planet evokes passions of both courage and fear with all the consequent conflict and trauma for leavers &amp; remainers as well as for inviters &amp; excluders. 

Ironically, much of the desperation of people in poor countries is aggravated by some, perhaps well-intentioned but calamitous, behavior by governments in prosperous countries: i.e. trade manipulations, drug wars, and assistance to foreign rulers. This assistance to rulers includes the closing of escape routes. Likewise, well-intentioned domestic government assistance and a multitude of labor and commercial laws have forcefully aggravated the adjustment and tolerance of migration into relatively prosperous and free countries. 

Of many models possible as a solution to these dilemmas of migration, Hong Kong provides useful historical lessons that are practical, humanitarian, and ethical from a libertarian perspective.

                      Cypherpunks and cryptoanarchists have always dreamt of truely anonymous financial systems. This lead to Bitcoin and other blockchain cryptocurrencies. One episode of this development is widely overlooked today: Digital Cash, eCash, eCache and other Digital Bearer Certificate (DBC) systems.

DBCs enable blazing fast, anonymous and untraceable transactions that resemble cash transactions much closer than cryptocurrencies. They are conceptually simple and require much less complex infrastructures. Nevertheless they have been ignored by cryptoanarchist researchers over the last decade.

In this talk we shall explore the necessary properties of government-independent value transfer systems, how to decentralize DBCs, and what a future with digital anonymous micro-transactions means for the realization of cryptoanarchist ideas.

                      Dominance is back to 70%, which begs the following question: is it just getting started as it surpasses it's former status (pre-2017 bubble) or will the Alt Season come back? This presentation will thoroughly demonstrate how Altcoins like Litecoin &amp; Monero and Blockchians like Ethereum &amp; Cordana are truly shitcoins and the only path for them is towards a value of 0.

                      Decentralized systems are meant to be trustless. But our interactions with tech is always mediated by software. This talk will cover the threat, including real and hypothetical attacks, what it takes for communities to defeat these attacks, and how we can better design decentralized systems to defeat these attacks.

                      Civilization is going through a rapid radical shift, from a pre-Internet age to the Uberification of Industry, the Decentralization of Education, and the Polarization of Government. Both Industry &amp; Government have figured out how to exploit the loopholes in the economic models of Capitalism &amp; Socialism, without any ability for citizen people to opt-out. In this talk, we'll explore the 6 problems any economic system must address and see if there are holes that humanity can escape through.

                      FOSH (Free and Open Source Hardware) in the past years has moved away from being a small niche and has developed to a relevant movement with significant and well-known projects. Open Science Hardware offers an opt-out potential against centralisation, as visible in the "Safecast"

Crowd Science Geiger Counter, which offered concerned people a chance to fact-check radiation levels after the Fukushima incident in Japan.

Open Hardware has a success story to tell - but what does "open" in this context mean? How open can hardware be, post the age of microcomputing? Verifiable hardware could even help future nuclear disarming (see 34C3, "Vintage Computing for Trusted Radiation Measurements and a World Free of Nuclear Weapons"). In contrast, the actual hardware landscape is neither very open, nor verifiable.

Additionally, HSMs and TEEs are challenging zero-trust by introducing novel attack vectors. Mistrust in modern day processors are growing, especially after “Spectre”, “Foreshadow” and “Spoiler”. Full Opt-Out possibility is presently not possible, Free and Open Source Silicon can the first step to a Zero-Trust society - but the future remains speculative.

                      We are deeply entrenched in numerous socio-technological systems that structure our everyday life. They function by channelling, prohibiting, controlling, limiting, categorizing, standardizing (…) our behaviour. Just count how many of these systems you have “joined/used” to this very day.

Current ideas and attempts at finding a technological solution to help us opt out from this “first constrained realm” are not entirely novel.  In light of this congress, the one most worth considering is the very notion of a decentralized and free computer network, one which should catalyse a positive societal revolution and leave behind the evils of centralised and alienating state-corporate systems.

By employing a sociological approach (namely sociology of technology), we will look at what went wrong in the socio-technical history of the free computer network project and examine how the resulting system forms new hard-to-escape dependencies. 

Was A Declaration of the Independence of Cyberspace too early, just in time or too late? Is it even possible to construct a technological infrastructure to opt out of “the first realm“? Which sociological criteria would facilitate an opt-out system? And lastly, how are new dependencies formed when two parallel systems meet?

                      Science fiction has always served as a testbed for the reimagining of possible organizational structures outside of the existing state apparatus. We will present a historical analysis of previous attempts - both in SF literature and IRL - to exit existing power structures and move towards a practice of creating counter-economic and ecologically-oriented organizational structures, as well as discuss the tactics and experiments for doing so we assumed whilst working on terra0. Following this grounding, we will present our conceptualization of counter-economic ecological actions, how DLT, p2p systems and asymmetric key cryptography can help actualize them, and what we think this means for the future of tech development and social coordination.

                    Mr. Park was born in 1968 in Hyesan, Yanggang Province, North Korea. After graduating from The Communication College, Park worked at the Radio Wave Surveillance Station from 1993 to 1998 as a supervisor. He continued his education at Yanggang University, where he graduated with a degree in Agriculture in 1998; shortly after, he decided to defect with his five other family members. Park had to hide for two and half years in China until he made his way to South Korea in 2001.&nbsp;<br><br>Mr. Park is a highly respected member of the North Korean defector community in Seoul who does many community outreach programs and ventures to help the defectors that live in his area, including food distribution, and community activities and events such as New Year's family gatherings and sports events.&nbsp;<br>Since his arrival in South Korea, he has helped his brother with the balloon launches into North Korea and has also established an after school education center for North Korean defector children in Seoul, 'Kuen Saem Education Center' which provides free English lessons and other tutorial help. Mr. Park is also the founding members of the 'Send Rice Aid Directly to the North Korean People', a project of Kuen Saem which sends rice and USBs and other goods in plastic water bottles into North Korea via the ocean. This project is currently the only regular humanitarian and information delivery project carried out into North Korea, and has spoken about this project and the school at the U.S. State Department, events in Washington, D.C., and most recently, at the annual Internet Freedom Festival (IFF) in Valencia, Spain.

                      Technology to skip the present times is available today, and improving fast. It is not for the faint-hearted, for sure. But for safely landing into the future, not as a poor immigrant from the past, but rather as a rich tourist, technology is not enough. The right incentives must get aligned and be put to work. This talk is about what is missing, and how Crypto could be the final ingredient to really achieve time travel.

                    Yisi is now working with fantastic developers at Dimension.im on various projects towards a decentralized and privacy-preserving web. He is focusing on how to apply cryptography algorithms and schemes to the real world, including two ongoing projects at Dimension, maskbook.com and tessercube.com, to bring users a web with privacy. He used to be a natural language processing researcher but decided to work on real-world cryptography and data privacy protection when he realized the double-edged sword of how big companies are using and "abusing" user's data in their lives. He is a true believer of the decentralized web and would like to bring it to more users all over the world.

                      A brief introduction to decentralized identities and how our open-source company enables users to talk freely on the existing Internet.

People are under massive censorship on the current Internet. They cannot escape but stay because they never have an option: all their connections are still on the same platforms and most of them don't even know that their privacies are being violated. We will discuss this problem first and then propose our solution: maskbook.com and tessercube.com. Both of them are adopting a decentralized identity idea and enables users to protect their privacies without being violated by the companies. People finally got an alternative option that not only preserves their privacies but also letting them stay on the existing Internet. We believe this would help users move towards crypto-anarchism.

                      Linking physical reality, brain activity and consciousness still stands as one of the most interesting and elusive problems of neuroscience, psychology, psychiatry and philosophy. Finding their mutual relationships represents the first step toward explanation how the brain process external information and how the picture of reality in our mind relates the world.

In this lecture, I deal with two central questions of consciousness: how and why? “How” refers to the theoretical and empirical approach to reveal the neural correlates and mechanisms that form consciousness. On the other hand, “why” refers to both the evolutionary origin and the question why is there conscious experience at all. 

The extraordinary states of consciousness elicited by the psychedelics, such as DMT, psilocybin and LSD, represent one of the most powerful tools for understanding neurobiology of consciousness and answering both “why” and “how” questions. The results of brain neuroimaging studies on the effect of psychedelic drugs on structure of consciousness provide an explanation for its phenomenological features, including unconstrained cognition, meaning of concepts of reality and a sense of expanded consciousness awareness. We will discuss how psychedelics, and other modern techniques such as neurostimulation, may increase cognitive flexibility and creativity, elucidate our understanding of the structure of external physical reality and enhance human potential in general.

                      In the era of ubiquitous surveillance and globally-banked cryptocurrency projects like Facebook's Libra, how can cryptoanarchists fight back? Through cryptographic code! We'll survey the grim state of surveillance, starting with the industrialization of NSA mass surveillance via companies like Chainanalysis to the recent targeting of Assange. We'll present two new systems that are capable of resisting even global adversaries with a full view of the network: Anonymous credentials and mix-networks.

We'll explain how new advances in mix-networking can be integrated with anonymous access credentials to provide end-to-end privacy against even the most powerful of adversaries.

We'll demonstrate how mix-nets provide better anonymity than either Tor or VPNs, and how probabilistic mix-networks such as Loopix can be extended to handle a decentralized environment. We'll also describe new advances in anonymous access credentials, so that with threshold signatures they also function in a decentralized environment. Lastly, we'll discuss how financial incentives enabled by blockchains allow these technologies to become self-sustaining.

                      Roman poet and philosopher Lucretius said in the 1st century BC that what is food to one, may be bitter poison to others. In 2019, hyperconnected, health-focused consumers return to this premise and claim the obsolescence of one-size-fits-all dietary guidelines in favor of personalized nutrition (PN) approaches. Drawing on the recent advances in self-quantification technologies, affordable machine learning, and genome sequencing techniques, PN practitioners experiment with food products and services tailored to their individual lifestyle preferences as well as phenotypic and genotypic traits. ​These practitioners are often motivated by their distrust in official dietary recommendations issued by food and health authorities, and prefer a knowledge derived through self-experimentation. By measuring and quantifying their everyday food intake and outtake, they aim to develop a — supposedly precise — data-driven understanding of their bodies and diets. ​PN provides opportunities for empowered human-food relationships but also risks regarding limited scientific validity, health safety, and data security.

This talk presents findings from our long-term research on emerging PN technologies, practices, and issues. I will discuss a three-year ethnographic study of the ​Complete Foods​ community of ‘diet hackers’ replacing their daily meals with personalized food powders, and share insights from our recent ​DNA Diets​ project exploring the risks and opportunities of gene-based PN. The ​Complete Foods​ (CF) study ​(2014-2017) involved interviews with 65 ​CF dieters, a content analysis of three ​CF​ ​community forums, and two autoethnographic self-experiments where I probed the opportunities and limitations of the diet on myself. The ​DNA Diets​ study initiated in 2019, involves experiments with the Promethease service enabling a DIY analysis of personal DNA test reports, and crafting of dinner menus tailored to my and collaborator’s genetic codes. ​Findings from both case studies will be discussed within the broader context of food-tech innovation and data-driven optimization of everyday food and health practices.

                      The media landscape is transforming as decentralized, peer-to-peer networks are emerging. In conflict zones, this can be a missing piece to expose what is really going on, and facilitate dialogue. What is the role of centralized media in conflict? How do can we deal with censorship and manipulation of information? Does objectivity exist?How do we prevent digital colonialism? How do we have a conversation with our enemy?&nbsp;

It is time to acknowledge the important role of technology to provide the utmost security and freedom of speech in conflict zones and highly government-controlled areas.

                      In a world where financial surveillance is a norm and banking secrecy is gone, what are our option? And how does the surveillance apparatus really work? 

The introduction of global regulations on financial transactions had a profound effect. As far as we know, no terrorists were caught because of them. Banking secrecy is gone. It is more difficult to conduct international business. International transactions are being examined and blocked. Commerce is slowing down. The banks are running a police station for the state, enforcing a regulation that is not clear. Conducting international business has become unpredictable.

This creates the value proposition for cryptocurrencies. They bring back privacy, the speed of transactions and are regulated by code, not international agreements. They are difficult to confiscate, some of them are fast, most of them are cheap. And some of them are anonymous. Are cryptocurrencies the next step in the evolution of the financial sector? Or is it a parallel solution to a pressing issue?

This talk looks at the development of financial surveillance. It looks at current financial surveillance and risk management systems. It covers the best use-cases for cryptocurrencies and their value proposition. They are not speculation for gamblers, but a solution to a new pressing issue.

                      This analysis of hostile state sponsored disinformation will serve as an introduction to the more nuanced analysis of Facebook, which plays a key role in those campaigns. This speech will explain Facebook’s shameful business model supported by AI algorithms with no ethical and social dimensions. This way, AI is used for the nasty dehumanization of mankind – in the name of profit and even more power for Facebook’s founder.

                      Each code of conduct is a derivative from nature of actors and nature of interaction between them. Humans have been trying to overcome (or suppress) their nature by creating moral standards, rules, by means of which they could judge each other and decide  whether to build the interaction further or to refuse and disrupt the communication. 

For the last decades we have been trying to apply our ethics and moral principles to other types of agents - artificial ones, in order to judge them and be capable of reacting accordingly. But do computers have the nature similar to ours that would make the application possible? Will the nature of interaction between artificial and biological agents be the same as human-to-human? Will AI have a goodwill to politely ask us to cooperate before tearing down our barbed wire fences?

                    Michal is co-founder of Parallel Garden and entrepreneur with special focus on strategic management. In 2014, he started his first cryptocurrency minning project and got involved in Paralelni Polis shortly after its foundation. Inspiration by fundamental ideas of Bitcoin and practical minning experience lead him to start solving residual heat produced by miners in project "Kotel" ("The Boiler" in Czech). Especially thanks to his experience he understood substantial significance in linking ("bridging") cooperation between the disciplines and further develops this activity.

                      You know the feeling: There is a an issue. The big one and globally significant. You understand its urgency and you would like to solve it. And you are alone, or there is only few of you. So what can you do? Get involved in politics. Initiate the protests or get involved in the existing ones. Will you succeed? Maybe or maybe not.

There is also another way of investing your time and energy - start the change on your own. Get a couple of similar minded people and start working on practical solutions. Make the first prototype. Then, address the relevant community with it and analyze the feedback. Learn, develop and scale after then. 

As a members of Paralelni Polis community, we were surrounded by several environmental clichés, mostly about the eco-unfriendly cryptocurrency mining. Actually, their substance was similar to many others environmental issues: many debates and only a few practically-based conclusions with very poor impact. So, we decided to take action. We built up our first hydroponic system, start cooperation with hackerspace in order to include automation. And start the path to automated rooftop greenhouse. We also open-sourced all of our know-how in order to make it spread as far as possible. The accurate feedback on the effect of our actions was substantial to us - so we refused state-based financial sources and emphasize the peer-to-peer relation. We will be happy to share our story with you! In the meantime, we don 't waste time and iterate!

AFTER THE TALK you are more than welcomed to join the guided tour - Parallel Garden team will show you hydroponic systems and FarmBot installed in Paralelní Polis and tell you further details.

                    Radim is attorney-at-law and proud implementer of Paralelni Polis ideas. As a co-founder of Parallel Garden, he is primarily in charge of legal agenda - however, not only in a way you would assume. Project based on ideas of Paralelni Polis demands effort to keep the compliance with its ideas. It covers either searching for specific rules, or even creating the new ones.  In 2017, Radim also co-founded Blockchain Legal, law firm focused on cryptocurrencies and digital technologies based in Prague.

                      You know the feeling: There is a an issue. The big one and globally significant. You understand its urgency and you would like to solve it. And you are alone, or there is only few of you. So what can you do? Get involved in politics. Initiate the protests or get involved in the existing ones. Will you succeed? Maybe or maybe not.

There is also another way of investing your time and energy - start the change on your own. Get a couple of similar minded people and start working on practical solutions. Make the first prototype. Then, address the relevant community with it and analyze the feedback. Learn, develop and scale after then. 

As a members of Paralelni Polis community, we were surrounded by several environmental clichés, mostly about the eco-unfriendly cryptocurrency mining. Actually, their substance was similar to many others environmental issues: many debates and only a few practically-based conclusions with very poor impact. So, we decided to take action. We built up our first hydroponic system, start cooperation with hackerspace in order to include automation. And start the path to automated rooftop greenhouse. We also open-sourced all of our know-how in order to make it spread as far as possible. The accurate feedback on the effect of our actions was substantial to us - so we refused state-based financial sources and emphasize the peer-to-peer relation. We will be happy to share our story with you! In the meantime, we don 't waste time and iterate!

AFTER THE TALK you are more than welcomed to join the guided tour - Parallel Garden team will show you hydroponic systems and FarmBot installed in Paralelní Polis and tell you further details.

                    Travin Keith, CTO of Consortio Group, is a former digital nomad who has lived in 8 countries across 4 continents. Since shifting from a primarily digital marketing background in 2016, he has worked in the cryptocurrency space, as a volunteer, such as with the Bitcoin Markets community, a Board Member, with the Nxt Foundation, an advisor and consultant for a wide range of projects, as well as an entrepreneur with his ventures Agavon, Altrean (both now defunct), and Stokr, of which he is a current Advising Co-Founder, to name just a few. He has also contributed significantly to open source projects in and out of the cryptocurrency space, especially with Hyperledger, of which he co-authored the white paper. He has frequently spoken at events ranging from meetups to large conferences across the world, such as the Open Source Leadership Summit in 2018, hosted by the Linux Foundation, mainly around the areas of cryptocurrency and distributed ledger technology.<br><br>During his time as a digital nomad, of which he in some ways still is, he has encountered numerous issues with regards to both relocating and basic travel, personally through his own experiences and 2nd hand through the experiences of many others he encountered. At HCPP 19, he looks forward to discussing these as well as reporting on his research to highlight the dehumanizing issues regarding the current immigration systems around the world.

                      Numerous immigration systems around the world are broken. Though part of the reason is due to illegal immigration, a significant amount remains fixable, but isn't, due to the fact that most citizens of countries are never exposed to the problem, and most legal immigrants, sometimes known as an expat, either prefer to not do anything about it, perhaps out of fear of being mistreated, or are not able to influence change. Because of this, many problems remain that reduce the value of an individual and their own merits to where they were born, something that they have no control over, that cause burdensome processes that stifle business growth and economic freedom, or outright rejection. This presentation will go over relevant data from immigration policies around the world as well as personal experiences from the speaker, a former digital nomad who has traveled to 31 countries and lived in 8 of them, all while holding a passport of a country with a Global Passport Ranking of 133 out of 199 countries.

                      Last year my talk was devoted to uncensorable and unregulated artificial intelligence. This year I'd like to give more technical insights into the topic and describe how existing Bitcoin and Lightning Network technologies can be utilized to break the attribution between computing, messaging, storage and ownership — and physical identity of the person. Then, I will disclose why these steps are a required part of the equation that can eventually lead to digital immortality.

                      The Taproot implementation of the Schnorr signature scheme opens up a whole wide range of privacy protecting tools for Bitcoin transactions. Specifically the adaptor signature tweaks enable scriptless scripts which can be utilized to craft trustlees swaps of UTXOs that are indistinguishable from any other taproot transaction. This breaks the assumption of chain anal spies that "inputs pay outputs" with plausible deniability for anyone utilizing taproot. Max will elaborate on the powerful magic of time traveling the time chain with plausible deniability.

                      After fall of Soviet Union and years of political freedom most Russian people opted out of political life. It appears there are a lot more interesting things to do: travel, develop technologies, create the art, grew up children.

                      Towards a theory of adequate mining rewards. While some analysts have tried to derive the appropriate security budget / mining rewards from the future Bitcoin marketcap, I offer a bottom-up approach of looking at the onchain transacted values. We find there is an interesting correlation between how much gets transacted on-chain and how much the miners earn.

                      An introduction to Grin, the first public implementation of the Mimblewimble protocol. Grin is a cryptocurrency focused on privacy, scalability, and fairness, with a bottoms-up open community that is welcoming to all kinds of contributions. This talk is going to be an overview of the project. Particularly, I will try to explore how the project fares in what I consider as its core tenets, those of privacy, scalability, and fairness.

                      As we draw closer to an era where we are no longer bound by centralized rules dictating how our societies should function, we are in need of tools that can support our journey forward.

Our societies have been built from the top-down. Enforcement branching out with no care about how it would effect the people who must pay dearly for its fruits. We are all capable of assessing our needs, we are all capable of building a world shaped by those who live in it, rather than those who enjoy the privileged seats assigned to them.

Regulations are pushing to create boundaries for us to play in. Like obsessive parents, we are being told to play within the limits of their vision. As though the rules they had assigned us had done us any good thus far. The failure to see and acknowledge this has been the root cause of our perish. We are no longer looking for guidance, we seek something much greater. A sign of hope not built by fortune tellers, but by those who have all of humanity in mind. What tools can we use to "opt-out"?

                      Cryptocurrency from an attackers perspective means one thing: you can steal data that literally *is* money. A multitude of methods to prevent theft or at least make it harder have been developed over the years – several generations of hardware wallets, paper wallets, various elaborate cold storage systems etc. pp.. 2FA tokens for remote system access and similar devices are very similar in their properties. But they all have one weakness: if an attacker gains physical possession, the security margin shrinks – often too far. Even if an attacker can not reverse engineer the secrets out of access tokens or hardware wallets, he can manipulate the computing devices you use them with, gain valuable information through surveillance or trick you into doing stupid stuff. So the necessary protection envelope is bigger than you may think. This talk will take a look at how real-world attacks against offline and online devices are carried out these days, discuss how to develop an adequate threat model for your needs, explain some basics (like the difference between "tamper evident" and "tamper resistant") as well as typical pitfalls in this game. Finally we will show some new developments that make it easier to achieve better protection in various circumstances.

                      The talk covers architecture design choices, the different layers involved, the p2p messaging layer and discusses scalability. The second part demos a trade of an implementation implementing the OpenDEX protocol, an atomic swap between Bitcoin and DAI, a USD stablecoin via the Lightning and Raiden Network. The last part discusses the transition to a community-driven, open &amp; token free protocol and gives a glimpse into implications for society.

                      How loan can be replicated using derivatives, mainly futures and swaps. And how to enter such contracts in p2p fashion. The talk examines current possibilities how to take the loan backed by hodlers BTC and how to construct loan using BTC derivatives, mainly futures and swaps. In the end simple p2p derivative construction will be described.

                      Bitcoin backed trustless peer banking. What?

Think peers banking peers. Alice the “hodler” going long Bitcoin, Bob the “lender” providing her dollar liquidity for an interest, Charlie “the miner” hedging to dollars, Dave the “financier” balancing demand and supply liquidity and Emily the “trader” speculating on futures, options, FXs or stocks. All just above Bitcoin as the underlying and creating a parallel trustless financial system.

Think DeFi built on top of Bitcoin using Bitcoin multisig tech to get simple reliable smart contracts, using Bitcoin as the only reliable store of value.

Think open source third layer on top of Bitcoin, an accounting layer that can share liquidity and reconcile across on-chain and lightning settlement layers.

From theoretical concepts to real world products and how we can get this done.
